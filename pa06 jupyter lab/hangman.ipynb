    "# Hangman notes\n",
    "Your hangman homework has a number of different ways it can be completed. If you are having trouble completing it, you can use this notebook to guide you to a solution.\n",

    "## Describe the Algorithm\n",
    "Usually when we start writing a program we decide how we want the program to work. This is called the algorithm underlying the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "For hangman it might be something like this.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ask if they want to play a game, if not then return\n",
    "2. Generate a random word (w)\n",
    "   Also initialize the counter variable which keeps track of their remaining guesses\n",
    "   and initialize a variable to keep track of the letters they've guessed already.\n",
    "3. Ask the user for a letter and add it to the list of guessed letters\n",
    "4. If the letter has already been guessed or is not in the word, add one to the counter\n",
    "   and print a message saying they didn't guess a new letter\n",
    "5. Otherwise, congratulate them and print the letters in the word, but only showing the\n",
    "   letters they have guessed.\n",
    "6. If they have guessed all the letters or they have used up all of their guesses end the game\n",
    "7. Otherwise continue the game\n",
    "\n",
    "# Pseudocode\n",
    "The next step is to write the code as a combination of Python and English where the Python\n",
    "captures the \"top-level\" parts of the algorithm.\n",
